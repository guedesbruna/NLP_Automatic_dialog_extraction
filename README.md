# NLP_Automatic_dialog_extraction
Automatic dialog pattern extraction from assistant transcripts


files to be run in order 0,1,2 .py scripts
those 3 files substitute the content of pre-processing.ipynb
(only thing not covered in any scripts is the splitting for the sample, since I won't have to do it again. To check criteria used refer to preprocessing notebook)

then repair clean notebook is still under construction, but all commented for when I go back to applying rephrasing techniques.
